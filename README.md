### Organize data and perform financial analysis -Purpose

Helping organize that data to create summary tables, charts and graphs. To view data and filter our chosen data and provide a campaign timeline for Louise.

## Analysis of Kick starter campaigns and Challenges

Determined that theater is popular and successful type of campaign overall. By using filters, we can see that theater follows the overall trend. There is a spike in June but that reduces by the end of year. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Conclusion 1: The theater was most successful in the month of May and June. However, although these were the most successful months it was also when we saw the most failed. This can be determined by examining the points along the trends of the chart.

Conclusion 2: In contrast the theater was least successful in the month of December. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

When the goal was less than 100 there was a 71% success rate
There is a trend of when the goal increases the percentage of success 
decreases. 


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Encountered some errors when formulating a fundraising goal. Discovered that not every campaign has backers. After, addressing the errors we were able to trim the data and eliminate what we don’t need. After establishing a successful season and budget to kick start a campaign. I would recommend narrowing down the subcategory with a line graph to visualize what subcategory is most successful. This will give you an idea of what genre to propose a successful campaign. Lastly, there is no data on what may influence the success rate outside of the months of May and June. This can help Louise and future campaings be successful throught the year. 


## Results

After a deep analysis of that data, we can deliver a campaign strategy for Louise. Including a budget, timeline, and genre for a Kickstarter campaign. A successful campaign is in theater with a genre in plays. There is a 71% success rate if the goal is less than 100 and in the months of May and June.
